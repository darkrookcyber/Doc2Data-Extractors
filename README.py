Transform PDFs to Clean Data for Model Fine-Tuning

Effortlessly convert PDF documents into clean, structured data suitable for machine learning model fine-tuning. Follow these simple steps to go from raw PDFs to aggregated, clean data ready for analysis or training:

Step 1: Extract Text from PDF
Extract raw text from your PDF document into a text file:

bash
Copy code
python3 extract_text.py --input yourfile.pdf --output outputfile.txt
Step 2: Preprocess the Extracted Text
Run the preprocessing script to refine the raw text:

bash
Copy code
python3 preprocess.py outputfile.txt
Step 3: Clean the Preprocessed Data
Further clean the preprocessed text to ensure data quality:

bash
Copy code
python3 cleanData.py preprocessedfile.txt
Step 4: Prepare Data for Fine-Tuning
Aggregate and label the clean data, making it ready for machine learning model fine-tuning:

bash
Copy code
python3 prepForTraining.py --files /path/to/data1.txt /path/to/data2.txt --labels Label1 Label2 --output final_data.csv
By following these steps, you can efficiently process and prepare your PDF documents for various data-driven projects.
